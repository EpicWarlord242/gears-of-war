          Emergence Day, otherwise known as E-Day, was a swift, full-scale,
          coordinated, and unprecedented planet-wide assault on the surface of
          Sera initiated by the subterranean race of the Locust Horde. Six weeks
          after the end of the Pendulum Wars, nearly every major city on the
          surface of Sera was attacked by the underground forces from the
          Hollow, using both bio-engineered weapons and stolen human technology.
          All breaches were along the ground line, known as emergence holes, in
          what was a campaign of rapid dominance in a textbook military
          invasion. There were massive casualties reported everywhere the Locust
          arrived. Over a quarter of the total human population was killed
          within the first twenty-six hours, and millions reported missing. The
          attacks signaled the beginning of the Locust War.

          The goal of the Locust Horde was to exterminate the human race,
          allowing them to colonize the surface in order to escape the Lambent,
          an Imulsion-based infection that was spreading in the Hollow. In the
          immediate aftermath of the attacks, the COG responded by countering
          the Locust invasion with its entire military arsenal. The Locust Horde
          was able to deploy huge numbers of their forces into major cities on
          the surface at once. They were able to defeat all organized human
          resistance for over a year and had used the spoils of war to gather
          all available military and civilian technological equipment, and
          resources, to use against the COG and the few UIR nations that
          remained after the Pendulum Wars. The Locust Horde's onslaught and
          assault continued for a year until the Hammer of Dawn Strikes, in
          which the Hammer of Dawn technology was deployed on Locust-infested
          areas under the newly elected Chairman Richard Prescott.

          The attacks were conceived by Queen Myrrah, who first presented it to
          Professor Adam Fenix in 5 B.E. At that time, Myrrah did not want to
          attack the humans due to sending her army into another war and,
          despite her hatred, the little sympathy she had for humans. However,
          she saw it as necessary in order to escape the Lambent, and not
          believing the humans would help in their aid, nor ever accept them.
