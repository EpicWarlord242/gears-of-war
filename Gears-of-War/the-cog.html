            Sergeant Marcus Michael Fenix (COG tags CSID 293982-3932F-A1) ES is
            a Gear in the COG Army. Marcus served with distinction in the
            Pendulum Wars and Locust War, which earned him the Embry Star, the
            COG's highest military award, for his actions during the Battle of
            Aspho Fields. Following the Locust Horde invasion on Emergence Day,
            Marcus defended key cities during the Emergence in Kalona and
            Destruction of Halvo Bay. In 10 A.E., Marcus was court martialed for
            dereliction of duty during the Fall of Ephyra, in which the Locust
            invaded and occupied Ephyra. Marcus abandoned his post to save his
            father, Professor Adam Fenix, after receiving a distress message.
            Marcus failed to rescue his father and the Locust took Ephyra -
            forcing the COG to relocate to Jacinto City. Marcus was sentenced to
            forty years at the Jacinto Maximum Security Prison.

            Corporal Dominic "Dom" Santiago ES was a Gear in the COG Army during
            the Pendulum Wars, Locust War, Stranded Insurgency, and Lambent
            Pandemic. He was the younger brother of Carlos Santiago and
            childhood friend of Marcus Fenix, both war heroes of the Pendulum
            Wars. Santiago joined the army as a Commando and took part in
            Operation Leveler to obtain schematics for the Hammer of Dawn, which
            would later guarantee victory for the COG but resulted in the death
            of his brother Carlos. On Emergence Day, Santiago lost both his
            children. His wife, Maria Santiago, developed PTSD and went missing.

            Private Augustus "Cole Train" Cole, also known as Gus or his
            Thrashball nickname "Cole Train",[2][3] is a Gear in the COG Army
            and a former Thrashball player. Best known for playing with the
            Hanover Cougars as defensive lineman, Cole later joined the army as
            a Gear after his parents were killed by the Locust Horde on
            Emergence Day. His announcement of retiring from Thrashball and
            joining the war effort caused a massive spike in enlistments. During
            the majority of the Locust War, Cole fought alongside Cpl. Damon
            Baird. Cole rejected every military promotion that had been offered
            under the grounds that having rank was not going to affect how many
            Locust he could kill.[4] As part of Delta-One, Cole became part of
            the most reliable squad of Gears available to the COG, fighting on
            the frontlines of every major operation near the end of the Locust
            War, and continued fighting for the COG as part of Delta after the
            relocation to Vectes, fighting Stranded Insurgents, the new threat
            of the Lambent Pandemic and the rise of the Swarm.

            Corporal Damon S. Baird (COG tags CSID 06059-81111-96)[5] is a Gear
            of the Coalition of Ordered Governments Army and an expert in
            several technical, mechanical, and scientific fields. He also
            appears to be an expert in collecting and analyzing Locust weapons,
            other equipment, artifacts and documents.[6] He joined the COG Army
            on Emergence Day, and soon after met Augustus Cole, who became his
            best friend. Fourteen years later, he was a member of Alpha Squad
            during the Lightmass Offensive, but joined Delta Squad along with
            Cole after the rest of the squad was killed. After the successful
            conclusion to the offensive, he was assigned to lead Sigma-One with
            Cole, taking part in several battles against the Locust. During
            Operation: Hollow Storm, he once again rejoined Delta, and fought
            through the campaign to sink Jacinto. He joined the rest of the COG
            in its evacuation to Port Farrall and later Vectes, where the COG
            was forced to deal with the Stranded Insurgency, and later the
            Lambent Pandemic, during which Baird was often on the front lines
            helping formulate plans with the rest of Delta and Command. When the
            COG collapsed, Baird joined the rest of Delta aboard the CNV
            Sovereign as part of the rapid response force that would assist
            several settlements the remnants of the COG had set up on the
            mainland.

            First Minister Anya Stroud was the 1st First Minister of the
            reestablished Coalition of Ordered Governments and a retired officer
            in the COG Army during the Pendulum Wars and Locust War. Daughter of
            Major Helena Stroud, Anya joined the COG army to follow in her
            mother’s footsteps. Unlike her mother, she did not serve as a
            front-line Gear until 14 A.E. Instead, she became a communications
            officer and served in her mother's unit during the Pendulum Wars.
            There, she met fellow soldier and future husband, Marcus Fenix. In 2
            B.E., Stroud took part in the Battle of Aspho Fields, during which
            she witnessed the death of her mother. Anya continued to serve as a
            controller in the CIC during the Locust War. She was in
            participation of the Hammer of Dawn Strikes, in which Chairman
            Richard Prescott scorched 90 of Sera's surface outside the Jacinto
            Plateau to stop the Locust in 1 A.E.

            Clayton Carmine, and an unnamed fourth brother. In 14 A.E., Anthony
            was part of the mission to find and deploy the Resonator during
            Lightmass Offensive. He was killed just outside the House of
            Sovereigns by a Locust Sniper and was remembered as a hero by his

            Anthony Carmine, Clayton Carmine, and an unidentified Carmine. He
            served as a Gear soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments
            army and joined Delta Squad, which had previously been Anthony's
            squad, after completing his training, and was further trained by
            Sgt. Marcus Fenix and Cpl. Dominic Santiago. He fought in the

            Chief Sergeant Clayton "Clay" Carmine, also called Grub Killer by
            his fellow Gears, and Sarge by his trainees is one of the four
            Carmine brothers and a Gear in the Coalition of Ordered Governments
            army. Holding the rank of Private throughout the Locust War and the
            Lambent Pandemic , Clay is the oldest brother in the Carmine family,
            he is an experienced and veteran Gear; unfortunately, he is also one
            of only two surviving brothers of the Carmine Family. Like Dominic
            Santiago, the war with the Locust was extremely personal for Clay
            because of the losses his family have suffered. He bears a deep
            grudge with every Locust, Lambent or not. Clay continued fighting in
            the last days of both conflicts alongside Delta-One and lived to see
            their victory. While most of his comrades in Delta-One had chosen to
            retire from the military sometime after the war, Clay chose to
            remain in the army under the reconstituted COG. Rising to the rank
            of Chief Sergeant, Clay went on to become a training instructor for
            officer cadets and trained James Dominic Fenix (the son of his old
            comrade Marcus Fenix) and his friend Delmont Walker. Clayton soon
            returned to action during Swarm Invasion and assisted in the
            Evacuation of Settlement 2 along with the rest of Delta Squad and
            his niece by leading a unit of DeeBees to defend evacuees, although
            his niece Corporal Elizabeth Carmine was accidently killed by a
            Hammer Strike. He later fought in the Battle of Old Ephyra and
            helped to deploy targeting beacons for the newly activated Hammer of
            Dawn satellites and later helped to kill the Swarm controlled
            creature known as the Kraken.

            Colonel Victor Hoffman ES[4] SM was a Gear officer and the Chief of
            Defense Staff of the Coalition of Ordered Governments during the
            Pendulum Wars and Locust War, and former Director of Special Forces,
            answering only to Chairman Richard Prescott. Hoffman hated being
            promoted so high, preferring to remain a frontline Gear. He is a
            battlefield commander, and has fought alongside his fellow Gears in
            the Pendulum Wars, the Locust War, and the Lambent Pandemic. A
            military man to the core, Hoffman demands discipline and sacrifice
            from those under his command. Hoffman's strict adherence to these
            ideals has caused him to cross swords with fellow Gear, Marcus
            Fenix. He made his reputation with the Siege of Anvil Gate, and
            later further increased it with the Battle of Aspho Fields.
