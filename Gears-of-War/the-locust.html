            Queen Myrrah, also known as Subject EV-184-9, was the co-creator and
            Queen of the Locust Horde. The child of an Imulsion miner, Myrrah
            was born with a unique genetic reaction to Imulsion exposure. She
            was brought to the New Hope Research Facility as a subject to treat
            children afflicted with Rustlung and other birth defects caused by
            Imulsion exposure. After New Hope was shutdown by the COG, key
            subjects and staff were relocated to an underground laboratory in
            Mount Kadar by a fringe political group. Through genetic experiments
            led by Dr. Niles Samson, Myrrah's embryonic stem cells and Sire DNA
            were responsible for the creation of the Locust. In adolescence, she
            began a relationship with Dr. Torres and had their daughter Reyna.
            Myrrah was led to believe by Niles that her infant daughter was
            killed when Torres escaped with her. Distraught, Myrrah led the
            Locust to slaughter all the scientists, including Niles, and
            established themselves as an independent race.

          </picture>

          <p>
            Uzil RAAM was the High General of the Locust Army. RAAM was once a
            Drone soldier, then a member of the Theron Guard. His skill,
            intellect, strength, and his loyalty to the Horde and Queen Myrrah
            earned him the title of head of the military leadership of the
            Locust Horde. RAAM led the Bloodied Vanguard with Skorge against the
            Lambent during the Lambent War. He was also a member of the Locust
            Council during the Lambent War. RAAM had a passion to wipe out all
            of the Lambent and Humanity, and with his intelligence and
            willpower, he almost succeeded.
          </p>

        <h2>Skorge</h2>
        <div class="character-image">

          </picture>

          <p>
            Skorge was the High Priest of the Locust Horde. He is a member of
            the Kantus caste of priests, sharing their tall, sinewy frame. It
            would seem that after RAAM's demise he took the position of the
            Horde's highest military leader. He wears specialized armor, studded
            with spikes. He also sports several dreadlocks that seem to come
            from his helmet (though they may be his hair or tentacles). In
            addition to standard Kantus priest combat equipment, he uses a
            formidable bow-staff with chainsaws at each end. He too is killed by
            Marcus Fenix, aided by Dominic Santiago. He is also seen jumping out
            of the ground, chainsawing a tank in half, and protecting the Queen
            as well as performing reconnaissance as stated by the Queen

        <h2>Berserkers</h2>
        <div class="character-image">

          </picture>

          <p>
            Berserkers are the females of the Locust. They are much larger and
            stronger than their male counterparts, but evidently feral and
            blind. Berserkers are easily angered and will kill Human and Locust
            alike with their bare hands. They are effectively bulletproof, but
            intensely vulnerable to high temperatures. Incendiary weapons,
            whether a Scorcher Flamethrower or even the Hammer of Dawn, will
            severely soften a Berserker's armoured hide, rendering her far more
            vulnerable to other weaponry.

        <h2>Boomers</h2>
        <div class="character-image">

            <img src="images/boomer.webp" alt="boomers" class="character-img" />
          </picture>

          <p>
            Boomers are large, barely intelligent Locusts that are often given
            the 'Boomshot' grenade launcher. They are often seen partnered with
            other Boomers, but they do not use infantry tactics, instead they
            move forward slowly and fire their weapons. To combat this tactic,
            many Gears have noted that an easy way to defeat a Boomer is to stay
            behind cover and bring them down with automatic fire. Boomers mainly
            can be heard laughing and saying "Boom!" before they fire.
          </p>

        <h2>Drones</h2>
        <div class="character-image">
          <picture class="floatLeft">
            <img src="images/drone.webp" alt="Drones" class="character-img" />
          </picture>

          <p>
            Drones appear to be the common race among the Locust Horde. They are
            larger than humans and have chalky white skin with gray, scale-like
            patches that most likely are hardened to protect them from minor
            damage. Sniper Drones often wear goggles for increased accuracy.
            They were bred in the Hollow to be bloodthirsty fighters. When
            ordered, Drones will throw their lives away by the hundreds to kill
            one Gear. They often crawl out of "emergence holes," which the
            Locust use as a bridge between underground and the surface world.
            Drones follow basic infantry tactics of flanking, dominating the
            terrain, and setting up ambushes. Almost fearless, they know little
            in the way of self-preservation and rarely retreat. They will
            usually wield the Hammerburst assault rifle. While some regular
            Drones have taken to using the human Lancer assault rifle, (Dubbed
            Cyclops for the headgear they normally wear in tandem with wielding
            the Lancer) and will use the chainsaw bayonet. Most basic drones
            wear a helmet and body armor while Grenadiers mainly go into battle
            armorless except for shoulder plates. Aside from standard drones,
            there are eight variants that are basically the same creature:

        <h2>Theron Guards</h2>
        <div class="character-image">
          <picture class="floatLeft">
            <img
              src="images/theronGuard.webp"
              alt="Theron Guards"
              class="character-img"
            />
          </picture>

          <p>
            Theron Guards serve as the elite of the Locust Horde. Easily
            identified by their sibilant voices and ornate full-body armour.
            Therons are stronger, faster, and excessively more intelligent than
            an average drone. They usually wield Torque Bows. They are also the
            only known locust race to carry and use more than one weapon at any
            one time. It is unclear if there is a ranking structure among the
            Therons, although General Raam was once himself a Theron Guard.
            During the evacuation of Illima city, an individual Elite Theron
            served as Raam's lieutenant. Queen Myrrah also had a personal
            batallion of specialist Therons known as the Queen's Guard.

        <h2>Corpsers</h2>
        <div class="character-image">
          <picture class="floatLeft">
            <img
              src="images/corpser.webp"
              alt="Corpsers"
              class="character-img"
            />
          </picture>

          <p>
            Corpsers appear as horrific giant spider-like monsters covered by a
            mysterious armored helmet. Their heads appear almost humanoid except
            for their insect like eyes. Corpsers have eight thick rock
            camouflaged legs that guard their vulnerable underbellies, which is
            the only exposed part of one's body besides their mouth. The Locust
            Horde uses Corpsers to dig tunnels through the soil of Sera,
            allowing the other members of Locust to move about undetected, and
            even allows the Horde to dig behind COG lines. Corpsers are often
            seen moments before Locust attacks, and they are often symbolized
            leading the Locusts out of the ground on Emergence Day. The Jacinto
            Plateau, which is positioned on a huge slab of granite and marble,
            it is the only place on Sera that the Horde can not dig through
            quickly which made it suitable for the COG's main Headquarters.
            Interestingly, infant and adolescent Corpsers tend to have half as
            many arms as their adult counterparts, implying that Corpsers grow
            additional arms as they age.

        <h2>Brumaks</h2>

            <img src="images/brumak.webp" alt="Brumaks" class="character-img" />
          </picture>

          <p>
            Brumaks are huge monsters with extraordinarily thick hides. They
            often grow to 12 meters in height and tend to weigh around 10,000
            kilograms (22,046 lbs). They were apparently bred by the Locust
            Horde from smaller native apes. Brumaks are lethal at close range,
            and they have also been rumored to carry energy beam cannons to kill
            at a range. Their head-gear resemble the Corpser's helmet, but their
            bodies have more in common with humanoids than spiders. Brumaks
            appear to be a form of a sentient being, and can carry weapons on
            their back for attack.
